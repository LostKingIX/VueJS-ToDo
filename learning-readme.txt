Learning Notes for To-Do SPA:

### What are we planning to build?
We are developing a full-stack to-do list application that allows users to sign in and manage personalized tasks. The application will support essential task management operations, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, all through a smooth and responsive interface.

### What technologies are we using to build it?
We are leveraging **React** for the frontend, **Django** for the backend, and **MongoDB** as the database. These technologies enable a seamless Single Page Application (SPA) experience with an efficient connection to the backend, ensuring secure user authentication and data storage.

### What is each technology responsible for?

- **React (Frontend)**: Handles the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience. It is responsible for rendering components, managing client-side routing, and communicating with the backend API to display or modify task data.

- **Django (Backend)**: Acts as the core engine that processes API requests, handles business logic, and manages user authentication. It interacts with the MongoDB database to retrieve and update user and task data.

- **MongoDB (Database)**: Stores user accounts and their respective to-do tasks. It is responsible for maintaining the data structure that supports personalized lists and user sessions.
